=================

## Extract PDF links from any URL

**Usage:** `python getpdflinks.py "<URL to scan for PDF links>" "<File to which results are written>" "<Delimeter>"`

All parameters are required, except for the delimeter parameter. The default delimeter is `\n`, a new line. Note that the output writing operation actually appends to the destination file.
